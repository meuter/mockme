1. fix the CLI to work with optparse
2. patch mockme to fwd -I and -D to cpp when parsing module
3. add some new kind of target to sconscript say e.g. DoubleModule() that calls mockme properly
4. make it work with double description macros
5. make sure that mockme works with function with "..." stdarg like fprintf
